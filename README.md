# DollaSensei Development Repository

DollaSensei is an AI-powered financial advisor designed to guide users toward smarter money management. By offering personalized insights on budgeting, saving, and investing, DollaSensei helps users make informed financial decisions with ease. It's your friendly, digital mentor, ensuring every dollar is put to good use.

## About This Repository

This repository is a **utility and exploratory workspace** for developing DollaSensei. While the main repository for the complete DollaSensei platform can be found [here](https://github.com/ebinzack15/DollaSensei), this space is intended for **exploration and experimentation** by the development team. Our focus here is on building and testing components, generating training data, and refining algorithms.

### Team

DollaSensei is being developed by:
- @p-s-vishnu
- @sujithhubpost
- @another_friend
- @ebinzack15 (me)

## Purpose of This Repo

This repo serves as a **development sandbox** for the team to:
- Experiment with different features and algorithms
- Generate and preprocess training data
- Develop utility scripts that can be used in the main project

The entire end-to-end project will be hosted elsewhere once development is complete. Stay tuned for updates as we progress toward a fully functional AI-driven financial mentor!

### Current Progress

- **161 data entries generated**  
  You can find the generated data [here](https://github.com/ebinzack15/DollaSensei/blob/main/data/161_output.json).

### Utility Scripts

In the `utils` folder, you will find:
- **Duplicate Removal Script**: Helps clean up redundant data.
- **Shuffle Data Script**: Randomizes data order for unbiased processing.

More scripts and utilities will be added as development continues.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build and refine DollaSensei!
